## Introduction to JavaScript Exercises

These are test driven development oriented exercises from the
[Introduction to JavaScript and Web Development
](http://montanacodeschool.com/other-courses/intro-to-javascript-web-development-26501983145/) two day class offered by [Montana Code School](http://montanacodeschool.com).

The first is from the
[Fizz Buzz drinking game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz),
where multiples of 3 are converted to 'Fizz', multiples of 5 to 'Buzz', and
multiples of 3 and 5 are converted to 'FizzBuzz'. You need to add to the
implementation in fizzBuzz.js. And change the "xit" tests to "it" to activate
them in fizzBuzzTest.js.

The second is a converter of Roman Numerals into regular JavaScript
integers. You need to add to the implementation in romanNumeralConverter.js,
change the "xdescribe" to "describe" and "xit" tests to "it" to activate them
in romanNumeralConverterTest.js. You can add more tests for more roman
number examples.

The third is the beginning of a Tic Tac Toe game.

Continue the class with the Full Stack Web Application [IntroJS-TODO

## Getting Started

To start, we recommend you install the *current*
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Then run 'npm install' in the project root directory to get mocha and chai.

Tests should be run with 'npm test'.

We are using the free and Open Source text editor [Atom](https://atom.io/)
in the class.

## Learning Resources

There are many online learning platforms, many of which cost money. We highly recommend these
two free resources to support your learning.
* [Exercism - TDD oriented exercises in many languages](http://exercism.io/)
* [FreeCodeCamp.org - methodical exercises for programming](http://freecodecamp.org)
* [JavaScript Koans](https://github.com/mrdavidlaing/javascript-koans)

Perhaps the best way to keep learning is to support each other and learn
together. FreeCodeCamp encourages local groups to self-organize, as did a
group in Missoula:
* [FreeCodeCamp Missoula on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/free.code.camp.missoula)

We highly recommend you also join the Montana-Programmer's on Meetup.com. You can attend
presentations and networking events. Consider also posting your own learning events. One of the
best ways to learn something is to teach it.

Though the teachers of the class have not found these books to be especially
helpful to them personally, some have found these JavaScript books useful.
* [A Smarter Way to Learn JavaScript](http://www.asmarterwaytolearn.com/)
* [JavaScript: The Good Parts](https://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Good-Parts-Douglas-Crockford/dp/0596517742)
* [JavaScript & jQuery: Interactive Front-End Web Development](https://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-JQuery-Interactive-Front-End-Development/dp/1118531647)

And here is a book about Mob Programming.
